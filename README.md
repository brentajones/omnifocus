Here's some Omnifocus stuff I use.

Here's Omnigroup's [documentation on installing plugins](https://omni-automation.com/plugins/installation.html)

### [Cycle Project Type](https://github.com/brentajones/omnifocus/blob/main/Cycle%20Project%20Type.omnijs)

I wanted to be able to create projects from the keyboard, and got annoyed by needing to use the mouse to change project type. I found [this plugin](https://discourse.omnigroup.com/t/keyboard-shortcut-to-turn-selected-project-or-task-group-parent-to-sequential/63128) by unlocked2412 in the forums, but I wanted to cycle through all the types.

This works with one or multiple projects selected. The order is **sequential** -> **single-action** -> **parallel**. If you have multiple projects of different types selected, on the first run of this plugin they'll all be changed to sequential.
